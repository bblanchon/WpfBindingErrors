Turn WPF binding errors into exceptions
=======================================

This project is a reusable assembly that converts WPF binding errors into exceptions.

Feel free to include it in your own project.
    
Content
-------

 1. Class `BindingException` is the typed exception thrown when a binding error occurs
 2. Static class `BindingExceptionThrower` is the one that throws `BindingException`.
 3. Class `BindingErrorListener` adds a listener to `PresentationTraceSources.DataBindingSource`. It raises the event `ErrorCatched` whenever a binding error occurs.
 4. Class `ObservableTraceListener` is internal; it's an override of `System.Diagnostics.TraceListener` and it raises the event `TraceCatched` whenever a trace is written.
     
See an example in project `SampleWpfApplicationTests` in this repository.

How to use it?
--------------

The simplest way is to use `BindingExceptionThrower` because it handles everything for you:

```csharp
BindingExceptionThrower.Attach()
```
    
That's all.  
Once you called `Attach()`, every WPF binding error will raise a `BindingException`.
See an example in project `SampleWpfApplication` in this repository.

However, if you want to be aware of binding errors without throwing an exception, you can use `BindingErrorListener`  and attach to the `ErrorCatched` event.

```csharp
using( var listener = new BindingErrorListener())
{
    listener.ErrorCatched += msg => Console.WriteLine("Binding error: {0}", msg);

    // ...do what you want here...
}
```
